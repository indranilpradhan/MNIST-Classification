# MNIST-Classification

1. Implement Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) as
well as Support Vector Machines(SVM) to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.
You can find the data here http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
2. You are allowed to use scikit-learn as well as deep learning frameworks such as
PyTorch, keras etc, for this purpose.
3. Report accuracy , Confusion matrix and any other metrics you feel may be useful.
4. Experiment with different architectures(number of hidden layers, activation functions etc., kernels in the case of SVM) and see the impact on performance. Summarize your findings in the report.
